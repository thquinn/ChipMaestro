Chip Maestro
============

[Successfully Kickstarted](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jarek/chip-maestro-an-nes-midi-synthesizer-cartridge) in 2011, the Chip Maestro is a custom NES cartridge. Put it in an NES, plug in a MIDI keyboard, and play it like a sweet synthesizer! Concept and hardware by [Jarek Lupinski](http://www.soniktech.com/), programming by me.

More project information is available [here](http://cargocollective.com/tomquinn/Chip-Maestro). This code is presented as-is, etc. etc.
